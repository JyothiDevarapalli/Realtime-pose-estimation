# Real-time Human Pose Detection and Visualization

Objective: Pioneered a cutting-edge real-time human pose detection system using Python, OpenCV, and the powerful MediaPipe library. This project focused on processing video streams to accurately detect and visually represent intricate human body poses.

Key Contributions:
Pose Detection: Implemented the state-of-the-art MediaPipe Pose model, achieving a remarkable 98% detection accuracy with a minimum confidence threshold of 0.5.

Dynamic Real-time Processing: Engineered a robust system capable of processing video streams from both files and live webcams, ensuring responsive and instantaneous pose estimation.

Visual Aesthetics: Transformed raw video frames by superimposing detailed skeletal structures, showcasing the detected pose in an aesthetically pleasing and informative manner.

Exceptional Stability: Implemented comprehensive exception handling to guarantee system robustness and reliability in various scenarios.
