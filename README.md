# Realtime-pose-estimation
The project's goal is to estimate a person's stance in real time. Any movement detection project that uses recorded movies or live recording can reuse this deep learning project.

The body motions are detected and tracked using the Mediapipe module. Both recorded and live video may be used with it.With the aid of tracking, it can operate smoothly in real-time and collect 33 places on the human body.
